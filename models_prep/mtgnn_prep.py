Some info:
-MTGNN appears to only take in one value per node, so if we want to intake more we need to modify the code.
-MTGNN differentiates between Single-Step training (predict the next value) and multi-step training (predicts, say 6 values ahead) and the code is somewhat different for both.
In practice, both have a toggle, buildA_true which decides if we build an adjacency matrix or not. However there is no code to provide an Adjacency matrix for single-step (would need to modify the code)
and in multi-step, an adjacency matrix has to be provided (which is potentially discarded if buildA_true is set to True).
=>So edges_csv_to_adj is only necessary to be called for multi_step training.

As for converting the series.csv file, in multi-step we go through the generate_training_data.py function.
and in single-step we do not, so the routine is different.

TODO: Document how to actually run MTGNN with the necessary function calls
=>Basically, how do we pass these data files to the model afterwards.
