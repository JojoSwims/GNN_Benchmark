THE BELOW TESTS ARE FOR METRLA
Afterwards, extra tests and checks are necessary to check behavior with datasets that do not have the same shape.
=>The above refers to two dimensions (How are timestamps dealt with, how are )

Fully running and operational:

Awaiting check by Guillermo, thinks look good on my side:
-GraphWaveNet (h5(DCRNN), pickle (Only shape was tested))
-GPST (npz, adj:same as our format, might need to rename columns)

Code Finished, awaiting testing:
-ASTGCN (npz, txt)
-GTS (h5, txt)
-MTGNN (h5, pickle, txt)


Code not completed:
-D2STGCN (Code is started however)
-MTGODE
-STAEFORMER

Todo:
    -Test npz
    -Test pickle (Need to check if columns are identical even if ordering is different)
    -Test txt
